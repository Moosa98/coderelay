Database is used to store the complaints and username, passwords

-> The Officer Management Tab for Officers updates the escalation/Complaint Status locally and does not move it to the database. This is due to lack of space/read request avaialble in free of cost databases
->officer and students have 2 tabs each and each of them cant access the other
->Officer can give up their access to other users but going to user setting on top right corner and entering the new officer's details. Students dont have access to modify details
->Students cant access officers tab and vice-versa
->A higher level officer can modify requests of his level and below his level. For example, Officer 2 cannot escalate, reject or respond to Officer 3's complaints but can work on complaints assigned to officer 1
->A complaint when logged is initially assigned to Officer 1
-> Students can track complaints raised only from their User Id and not from others
-> Officers can view complaints from everybody and not only from specific set of students but can edit/modify only certian complaints and not all of them
